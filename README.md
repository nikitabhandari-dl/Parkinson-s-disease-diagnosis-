# Parkinson's-disease-diagnosis
Machine learning methods for feature selection and classification of Parkinson's disease cases and healthy controls.

# Description
This project implements three features selection techniques intended for diamentionality reduction and compared the classification performance of various machine learning techniques.

Current version of project provides the following list of feature selection algorithms:

>Diffential Gene Expression Analysis
>LASSO regression
>Ridge regression

And the following list of classification machine learning algorithms:

K-nearest neighbpor
Support vector Machine
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Naive Bayes
Gradient Boost

More implementation details of the above methods can be found here:
